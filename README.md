# Corporate Governance Data Extraction using RAG

## The State of Board Diversity: Portugal's Journey (2013-2023) and Its Place in Europe in 2023
### The results from the analysis are present at the presentation event conducted by EU, Odgers Berndtson Board Solutions, IPCG - Instituto PortuguÃªs de Corporate Governance, and SRS Legal on October 29th 2024

In this new study we analyze the evolution of boards in Portugal over the last 10 years (2013-2023), through fundamental indicators for the composition of boards of directors, which include gender diversity, nationality, proportion of executives vs. non-executives, levels of independence, age distribution and tenure.
Throughout this decade, the corporate landscape has faced significant changes, and our goal is to provide a clear vision of how these changes have shaped the governance model of companies.
